The right to privacy -  surveillance in the digital age paper essay for social and ethical issues in IT course at unipi 21/22 a.y.

# Short Abstract.

In this paper, I argue that the privacy of citizens should not be violated by any means and that the intrusion of
government agencies into the private data or activities of citizens will not serve the public good. Furthermore,
I will provide details on the importance of privacy and why the government should need alternative methods
rather than collecting actions and activities of every citizen
